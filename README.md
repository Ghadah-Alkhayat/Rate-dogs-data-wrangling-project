# Rate-dogs-data-wrangling-project
This is one of my projects for Data Analyst -Udacity nano degree-

## Introduction:
The dataset that I wrangled, analyzed and visualized is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. 

## Wrangling steps:
1.1 Gathering Data

1.3 Cleaning Data
  
## Used langguage 
 Python:  pandas, numpy, requests, tweepy,  json and matplotlib.pyplot as plt
